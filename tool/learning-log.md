# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Kaboom**

## Project: **To create a game to help study with AP Chem**

---

### 9/29/25:
* Today i'm learning about the basics of kaboom
    * Kaboom is a Javascript game programming library that helps you make games fast and fun.
        * It's known for it's easy to use API and composable component system. This makes it easy for starters to use
* Kaboom info/Basics
    * Make sure to use CDN and **NOT** NPM to install Kaboom
    * [File](kaboom-basics-1.html)
        * In this file I used all the code in the [Kaboom intro](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/intro) and learned some of the basics in kaboom.
        * All notes taken from kaboom code are in my [SEP-11 notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18-m2Xyw4GJjMvw5X4Om5a-GfJZ4sW0Rz5B4jdb_gCt4/edit?tab=t.0)
### 10/27/25:
* I decided to try and make a "game" with what I had learned on 9/29 just to see what I could do and have an idea of what I want to learn in the future
    * [File](test-game-1.html)
    * I learned how to make my player move left and right, though it's not smooth like I expected it to be
        * I did this by using functions to let the player be able to move a certain distance when the key is pressed
        * I plan on fixing this by learning how to make smooth movement with kaboom
    * I also learned how I could incorporate functions with kaboom already a little
* I plan on using a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OaHB0JbJDI) to help me learn more about the basics as well as help me recreate already made games to possibly us some of their code to put into my freedom project
### 11/10/25
* Today I will start watching the video and split it up into 4 parts: The Basics, Space Invaders game Mario game, and Zelda game.
    * I will start off from the basics and move in the listed order
BASICS: What is goes over (Refer back to notes to know the code) **NOTE: THIS VIDEO WAS RECORDED IN AN EARLIER VERSION OF KABOOM**
* Goes over how to add a sprite
* Goes over go to add a level

Extra notes:
* Usually just make a folder for every testing game since sprites take up a lot and will be easier to manage with a folder

Summary of everything covered in the video so far
* Due to video's version of Kaboom being out of date, it seems like functions don't work the same
    * This could be resolved by learning straight from the [kaboom page](https://kaboomjs.com/) instead of the video
* I think for now I will just start learning from the kaboom page so I know the code for the latest version of kaboom
    * When I think I have a good enough understanding of all the code on kaboom page I can refer back to the video to see if I can do it then but with the most recent version of kaboom

### 11/17/25

* Today I will be going back into the same [file](kaboom-basics-2/kaboom-basics-2.html) I was using to learn from the video since I still want to learn how to use `addLevel`
    * I figured out why my code wasn't working for `addLevel`, it turns out one of my sprites was named wrong so therefore wouldn't load in correctly and caused my whole code to not work.
    * I added the same features from my other code so the player can move around, in the same choppy way
